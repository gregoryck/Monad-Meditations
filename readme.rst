ListMeditation.hs
   Just rewriting some simple computations in list comprehension notation, 
   do notation, and >>= notation.
StateMeditation.lhs
   Literate Haskell. An exploration of the State monad, considerably more involved. Walks through the do notation and >>= notation to describe a State monad,
   then surveys the many, many functions to work with one afterward.
StateParser.lhs
   Not sure if I'd call this a parser. But it will be an application of the State monad.


TODO
----
- Monad transformers.
