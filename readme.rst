ListMeditation.hs
   Just rewriting some simple computations in list comprehension notation, 
   do notation, and >>= notation.
StateMeditation.lhs
   Literate Haskell. An exploration of the State monad, considerably more involved. Walks through the do notation and >>= notation to describe a State monad,
   then surveys the many, many functions to work with one afterward.


TODO
----
- A more practical application of the State monad.
- Monad transformers.
